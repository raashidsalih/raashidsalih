## Hey there.

I am Raashid Salih, and as a CS graduate currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Analytics, my primary objective is to help your business make data profitable.

I intend to achieve said objective in a number of ways:
 - By developing and maintaining the infrastructure (cloud or otherwise) to make data readily available to the departments that require it for analysis.
 - By preparing more robust pipelines that facilitate consistent reporting for upper management decision making.
 - Finally, I can develop and maintain Machine Learning models that automate tasks and enable departments to achieve greater efficacy.

I am rather passionate about the applied data space, especially how modelling and analytics can have a tangible impact to a company's operations beyond just a proof of concept. As a result, my skill set spans across Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, and ML Engineering.


I am open to career opportunities and would be delighted to discuss how my experiences in the data analytics field can contribute to your organization's success. If that's the case, please [feel free to reach out to me.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raashid-salih/)
